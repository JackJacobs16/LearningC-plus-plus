# LearningC++
At the time of writing, I have been learning C++ for a few months, mostly by watching the educational series on YouTube by Kenny Yip (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnKe36F30Y4ZDNIOZ51sX25pWKQ1pkpTE&si=0Xh3pIKarygWB7bn). Whilst learning the syntax and how one writes C++ can be done by watching and reading, it is important to complete your own projects. Hence the creation of this repository.  
The repository will contain a series of small to medium size projects which demonstrate my learning of C++. I will try to do projects which incorporate various data types, data structures, and libraries, with most projects revolving around quantitative finance, data analysis, and algorithmic trading. 
I will of course do my best to reference any materials or resources which I have used in the making of these projects.
